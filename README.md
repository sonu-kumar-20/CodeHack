# CodeHack
This project is a competitive coding platform designed to enhance coding skills and provide an engaging experience through three unique modules. Coding Practice, Two-Player Contest,  and Multi-Round Tournament.
Coding Practice: A module dedicated to self-paced coding practice. Users can solve a wide range of coding questions, focusing on improving their knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.

Two-Player Contest: A real-time competitive feature where two players compete by solving the same coding challenges. The winner is determined based on solution complexity and time efficiency, promoting both accuracy and speed in coding.

Multi-Round Tournament: A large-scale contest that involves multiple participants. Players compete across several rounds, with eliminations after each stage. The process continues until a single winner emerges, making the contest engaging and challenging.
Project Description 
Project Overview:
